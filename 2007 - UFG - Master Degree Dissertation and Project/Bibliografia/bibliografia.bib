@incollection{placelab:2008,
	Abstract = {The Global Positioning System has spawned a wealth of locationbased
	consumer applications that would have been unthinkable a few years
	ago--cars that can give drivers door-to-door directions and, soon,
	cellphones that can tell you where the nearest shoe sale is happening.
	But these applications currently require a line of sight to three
	or four orbiting satellites simultaneously--something that can be
	a tall order in the dense, built-up urban areas that, ironically,
	are the areas most likely to produce lost drivers or shoe sales.
	Leveraging that very density to give location-based applications
	an alternative to GPS is the goal of a new research project being
	conducted by our Place Lab, a collaboration between Intel Research
	Seattle, Intel Research Cambridge, in England, and the University
	of Washington, in Seattle.},
